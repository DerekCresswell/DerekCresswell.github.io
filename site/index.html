    <p>
        I keep a list of projects that I have worked on <a href="/projects">here</a>.
        These projects are a mix of personal, professional, and open source contributions.
        They showcase my skills and interests in various areas of software development.
        I might throw in a few odd ball projects that aren't necessarily programming related, but are still interesting to me.
