<h3>Drupal Core, Commerce, Fraud, and Digest</h3>
<div class="paragraphs">
    <p>
        During my <a href="/about.html#career">first job</a>, I spent a lot of time working with the content management system <a href="https://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>.
        It was a wonderful experience to work on such a large and active open source project.
        The developers that are dedicated to this project showcase a deep technical knowledge and provide (much desired) scrutiny on any work submitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        I actively participated in fixing bugs and introducing new features to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal">Core of Drupal</a>.
        The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce">Commerce project</a> was my main focus and I contributed <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/derekcresswell/issue-credits/2475121">20 fixes</a> to the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_fraud">Commerce Fraud project</a>.
        This is a plugin that supports E-Commerce shops by identifying and stopping fraudulent purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, I built an open-source plugin that provides Digests of content from websites to users.
        This is the aptly named <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/digest">Digest module</a>.
        It is capable of sending real-time notifications to users about new content or build up digests on a given schedule.
        To me, a very interesting part of this project was how it lead me to contribute to several over open source projects as I began to use them in the digest.
        Notably, I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression">Cron Expression</a> library to provide my digests with their scheduling.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was honored to have my work on the Digest module mentioned during a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/case-study/500-foods-website">case study</a> of the <a href="https://www.500foods.com/">500foods website</a>.
        As a young developer, this was one of my highest achievements and gave me a real motivation to get my code into the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my tenure with Drupal, I was awarded the vetted role.
        This was given after core maintainers of Drupal reviewed my modules and determined that I was able to write secure, quality code for the community.
    </p>

        If you are curious, my profile is <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/derekcresswell">here</a> where you can see all of my contributions to Drupal.

    I'm still working with a bit of a backlog to upload my major projects here.
    Please have patience!
